# Tilda! A place to call home

In unix systems (and now even windows), "~" or "Tilda" is a symbol for the home directory. Tilda is a place for your courses to call home. Canvas, google meet, zoom, and kaltura, there are just too many platforms to keep track of. One could just use bookmarks, but this is much more elegant. 

Welcome ~


The school has a weird way of having us access our schedules. Finding lecture links is annoying, even with bookmarks. So I made Tilda. Tilda is a python script that generates a homepage for you based on your MyCampus credentials.
